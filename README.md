# Quantification of uncertainty to support self-adaptation in partially-observable systems

## Abstract  

Self-adaptive and autonomous systems (SASs) are expected to self-adapt based on incomplete information and the presence of unanticipated events. As such, the decision-making of a SAS is challenged by the underlying uncertainty. We focus on the uncertainty associated with the satisfaction of the quality goals, i.e. the non-functional requirements (NFRs) in a SAS, due to adaptation actions. Approaches that support the decision making of a SAS often consider an idealized reality where (i) the system’s state is treated as fully observable by the monitoring infrastructure, and (ii) adaptation actions are assumed to have known, deterministic effects over the system. However, the system’s state may not be fully observable in practice, and adaptation actions may produce different unexpected effects due to uncertain factors. 

This paper develops a novel probabilistic approach to quantify the uncertainty associated with the effects on the system’s state of executing adaptation actions. Supported by Bayesian inference, these effects can be translated into satisfaction levels of the NFRs of a SAS to drive decision making. Evaluations have been performed for two substantial case studies from networking and Internet of Things (IoT) domains using two different POMDP solvers. Results show that our approach to quantifying uncertainty is statistically significant.
